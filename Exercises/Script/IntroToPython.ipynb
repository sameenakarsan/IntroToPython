    "This very simple program introduces a few important ideas. You'll notice that the first line doesn't really look like code. Actually, it's not! The first line is a **comment**. We (and the computer) know this because the line starts with the symbol `#`. Python ignores that symbol and everything that comes after it, letting you write notes about what your code is doing. It's very important to put comments in your code, especially if you're going to need to come back to it after a few weeks or if you're going to share it with other people.\n",

While it's not necessary in this Jupyter notebook (which automatically outputs the result of the last line of code), it's very helpful if you're ever writing code in a different program, like *PyCharm* or *Spyder*. We'll discuss functions in more detail later, but the idea is that functions take inputs, known as **arguments**, do operations on them and optionally return some sort of modified result. Here, the `print` function takes in the **string** of text \"Hello, World!\", writes it onto the screen and doesn't return any new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **argument** that we pass to this function is the text **string** `\"Hello, World!\"`. We'll discuss strings in more detail later. The important thing is that a string is a group of characters surrounded by quotation marks (either single quotes `'Hello'` or double quotes `\"Hello\"`).\n",

    "### Python Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our first example, you can see that we've managed to embed some code **directly** into our learning material text... I owe you a bit more of an explanation...\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **interpreted** programming language. Basically, that means that it runs one line at a time, converting the code you write into code that your computer understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we write this code? Well, there are two main categories of software we can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python is interpreted, a single line (or short block) of code makes complete sense. So, we can work in an environment where we can write small chunks of code and run them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of such tools:\n",
    "* the `python` console on the command line (offers the bare minimum)\n",
    "* the IPython command line console (offers enhanced completion features, as well as syntax highlighting and history)\n",
    "* Jupyter notebooks (like this one, which offer the ability to mix text and code)\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools offer certain advantages:\n",
    "* it's easy to get results quickly\n",
    "* you can test out small snippets of code\n",
    "* your environment is gradually filled with data that you can interact with on-the-fly\n",
    "\n",
    "So, REPLs offer a great experience if you're learning, exploring a new idea, or if you want to take advantage of Jupyter notebooks and their ability to mix code and explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But... what if you don't want to be limited to writing small blocks of code?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "An IDE is a software tool that enables you to not only write code, but also manage your code files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples:\n",
    "* Spyder (similar user interface to MATLAB and RStudio)\n",
    "* PyCharm\n",
    "* Microsoft Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are extremely powerful, and almost universally offer the following features:\n",
    "* ability to work on large projects containing multiple files\n",
    "* rich support for code completion (including using LLMs)\n",
    "* code analysis and error detection\n",
    "* integration with version control systems (like Git)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an IDE helps with larger tasks, like package development or writing complicated scripts that you want to run on large datasets. Working on such projects also makes code easier to reuse and share.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What should you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Great question! You tell me!\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer depends on your use case. I've had projects where I've used both. Here are some things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What's your major focus? Code or analysis of results?\n",
    "    * If code (analysis can wait) - consider writing a script in an IDE.\n",
    "    * If analysis (you want to provide lots of descriptions and tell your reader about what they're seeing in the results) - consider using a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "* Do you want to share what you're working on?\n",
    "    * Yes - either IDE or Jupyter notebook (see above).\n",
    "* Are you just testing something out?\n",
    "    * Yes - use a REPL\n",
    "    * No - store the code in a file (don't rely on being able to go back in the console history... you never know if you may not be able to).\n",
    "* Are you developing a package?\n",
    "    * Yes - find a good IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't an exhaustive list, but hopefully you get the picture. There's no one-size-fits-all solution. You need to find the setup that works best for your uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We're sticking with a Jupyter notebook for this workshop, as it allows us to easily try out many different things and it lets me combine code examples with my explanations.** As you work on your own projects, decide what tools will best help you to achieve **your specific goals**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And with that, let's dive into programming!"

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To store data, we use **variables**. A **variable** gives a *name* to a piece of data stored in memory so that you can easily access it later. The information stored in a variable can change (or **vary**).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Python has no constants. Only variables. If you come from a language that has constants, I'm sorry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable Names\n",
    "There are rules for naming a variable:\n",
    "* Variable names are **case-sensitive**.\n",
    "* A variable name must contain only letters, numbers and underscores.\n",
    "* A variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "* A variable name cannot be the same as a reserved word in Python (see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) for list).\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable name may consist of multiple words combined. There are a few different conventions for putting words together. Two common ones are known as `snake_case` and `camelCase`:\n",
    "* In `snake_case`, all letters are lowercase and words are separated by underscores.\n",
    "* In `camelCase`, different words are combined with no spaces, and the first letter of a new word is put as a capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different people use different conventions. Your code editor may suggest one over the other (for example, PyCharm prefers `snake_case`). The choice depends on your project setup and any existing code you may be adding to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Although you can combine words together, try to keep variable names reasonably concise.\n",
    "* Although Python has no constants, `ALL_CAPS_NAMES` are sometimes used to denote variables that shouldn't change.\n",
    "* Variable names *can* start with underscores, but this often has a special meaning.\n",
    "* By **strongly encouraged** convention, we start variable names with a **lowercase** letter (or an underscore followed by a lowercase letter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some examples of valid and invalid variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Invalid | Valid |\n",
    "| ------- | ----- |\n",
    "| `my_variable12.3` | `my_variable12_3` |\n",
    "| `-myVariableName2`| `myVariableName2` |\n",

We had two numbers, and we had to put the correct sign, `>,<,=` in between (some of you were maybe also told to think of a crocodile opening its mouth to the bigger number...).\n",

    "* `a > b` -- **greater than**, evaluates to `True` if `a` is bigger than `b`, otherwise evaluates to `False`\n",
    "* `a >= b`-- **greater than or equal to**\n",
    "* `a < b` -- **less than**\n",
    "* `a <= b` -- **less than or equal to**\n",
    "* `a == b` -- **equal** -- ***NOTE:*** there are ***TWO*** equal signs!!!!!\n",
    "* `a != b` -- **not equal**\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, I want to emphasize that for the equals comparison, you must must must put two equal signs `==`! Otherwise, Python will think you're trying to assign a variable and it will get mad at you and give you an error!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for `>=` and `<=`, the order of the two signs matters! Do **NOT** write `=>` or `=<`! If you forget, remember that the order is the same as we read it. **Less that or equal to** is first *less than*, so `<` and then *equal to*, so `=`, so the order is `<=`.\n",

    "* A **list** represents a *variable-length collection* of objects. We can add or remove objects from the list using **list methods**, such as `append`, `insert` and `pop`.\n",
    "* A **tuple** represents a *small number of objects grouped together*. To access elements, we can either use slicing, or we can **unpack** its contents into the corresponding number of variables. Tuples can't be modified.\n",
    "* A **dictionary** represents *key-value storage*. Instead of having a numeric index, we access **values** using a **key**. We can add or remove elements using keys and we can modify the dictionary using **dictionary methods**, such as `pop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about any of these objects, check out the official Python documentation. There's a lot of detail about each type:\n",
    "* Strings: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str\n",
    "* Tuples: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple\n",

    "* Dictionaries: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there's another collection type that I didn't discuss, called a *set*. If you want to learn about it, check out this page: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say you're coming to this workshop. You take the metro and get off at Peel. You get out at the corner of Metcalfe and de Maisonneuve and look around. In your head, you're thinking, `if` Metcalfe is open, I'll walk up there, otherwise (`else`), I'll go to Peel. **Congratulations!!!** You've just done control flow!\n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow is about **making decisions** using boolean values. The important keyword here is `if`. Here is the syntax of control flow in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if some_boolean:\n",
    "    do_something\n",
    "elif some_other_boolean:\n",
    "    do_something_else\n",
    "elif yet_another_boolean:\n",
    "    do_another_something_else\n",
    "...\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    all_else_has_failed_so_lets_do_this\n",
    "\n",
    "some_other_code_here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the idea: \n",
    "\n",
    "* If the value of `some_boolean` is `True`, then the line `do_something` runs.\n",
    "* If the first branch isn't run, then we test to see if `some_other_boolean` is `True`. If it is, then we run `do_something_else`.\n",
    "* We keep checking all the branches until one of the conditions is met (evaluates to `True`).\n",
    "* If all conditions are `False`, then the code under `else` runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things to note about the syntax:\n",
    "* there is a **colon** (:) after the boolean value.\n",
    "* the line `do_something` only runs if the `boolean_value` evaluates to `True`. \n",
    "* the line `do_something` is **indented**. In other languages, you might be used to curly brackets. Python **DOES NOT** use these. In Python, different blocks of code are indented. Also, note that in Python, we don't need to write `end` when we're done! It's enough to stop indenting.\n",
    "* the line `some_other_code_here` runs *regardless* of whether the `boolean_value` is `True`. We can tell because it's **not** indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now, some notes about the different branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `if` branch is **required** (otherwise, there's not much of a point here...).\n",
    "* There is no limit to the number of `elif` clauses you can have. You can have zero, one, or as many as you want.\n",
    "* There is no requirement to add an `else` clause. You can have lots of `elif` clauses without a final `else`.\n",
    "* You can only have at most **one** `else` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's **SUPER IMPORTANT** to remember that **only one branch is run**. Once Python finds a condition that matches, it stops checking all the other branches.\n",

    "* *Think Python 2e* by Allen B. Downey (FREE book): https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/\n",
    "* *Data Structures and Information Retrieval in Python* also by Allen B. Downey (FREE book): https://greenteapress.com/wp/data-structures-and-information-retrieval-in-python/\n",
    "* *Introduction to Python Programming* by Udayan Das et al., published by OpenStax: https://openstax.org/details/books/introduction-python-programming\n",
    "* *The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python* by Kenneth Reitz and Tanya Schlusser: https://docs.python-guide.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also books online about more specialised topics, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Package development: *Python Packages* by Tomas Beuzen and Tiffany Timbers -- https://py-pkgs.org/\n",
    "* Data science:\n",
    "    * *Python for Data Analysis, 3E* by Wes McKinney -- https://wesmckinney.com/book/\n",
    "    * *Python Data Science Handbook* by Jake VanderPlas -- https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/\n",
    "\n",
    "Another book that covers software development for research more generally, including more emphasis on the tools used is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Research Software Engineering with Python* by Damien Irving, et al.: https://third-bit.com/py-rse/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the databases at the McGill Library, we also have access to lots of books **for free**. Check out the library's online catalogue to see more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorials are also great! And very much abundant! From more formal ones on sites like [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) to less formal ones on [DEV](https://dev.to/), you can get lots of insight from these. There are also lots posted on Medium that you can check out. In addition to text-based tutorials, there are also videos on YouTube. And don't forget the official tutorials in the documentation! Tutorials are a very valuable resource that can help you see how to put pieces of code together in real-world examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Want to try some bioinformatics examples?** Check out the Rosalind platform at <https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack Overflow (and Pitfalls)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a Python question, chances are that someone, somewhere has asked it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Stack Overflow is a **great** resource for finding answers to real questions about programming. **But** make sure that you're using it properly. Try the other resources before going to Stack Overflow. The answer may turn out to be on the documentation page for the function you're looking for. If there's a link to the docs in a Stack Overflow answer, **use it**. Check out in more detail. Make sure that you understand the code that you're about to add to your project and don't just copy-paste it. Coding is a thinking game. Make sure that you have thought about all the code that you're putting in and that you understand why it's there. And use your judgement and intuition when borrowing that code. If it looks sketchy, it could very well be sketchy and there may be a better way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ChatGPT (and Pitfalls)\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything I said above about Stack Overflow. And more. Answers on Stack Overflow are written by humans who have written the code, tested it, and run the results. Be careful when using ChatGPT for code (if you're allowed to at all). Make extra sure that it makes sense, and test it. Don't just trust it because AI wrote it for you. You need to make extra sure that it actually makes sense and runs properly, because you don't have that same guarantee that a human has used this exact code in their own experience. Use your coding judgement and intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, ALWAYS remember to **read the documentation**. Often, if you're stuck, the answer is **right there**. If it's not, then it's probably on Stack Overflow. It's often a good idea to check the documentation **first** to see if there's an official explanation or an official example. And don't just copy a Stack Overflow answer or sample code. Think about what the code is doing. Does it make sense? Is there a better way? Try to look line by line to understand what is going on (play around in the IPython interpreter or in a Jupyter notebook!).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Cool Programming Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I talked a bit about functions and classes, but there's much more that you can look into to help build your programming skills and write code that others will want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how to install and use packages. But, you can also **write your own packages**. There are many great resources online about writing packages. The one that I most recommend is [this free online book](https://py-pkgs.org/): *Python Packages* by Tomas Beuszen and Tiffany Timbers. It's an easy read and helps you learn not only how to organise your code, but how to publish it, too. The authors also walk through how to render your own nice-looking documentation and host that online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code with loops and control flow is fun, but it's even better when we can combine everything into functions and classes and work in an **object-oriented** manner. This paradigm helps you organise your code differently, constructing building blocks that can work together to build elaborate programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developing Graphical User Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks and command line scripts are powerful, but they aren't accessible for people who don't know how to code. Solution: build a graphical user interface! Using PyQt, the process is quite straightforward. Check out [this online tutorial series](https://www.pythonguis.com/) by Martin Fitzpatrick to learn about developing GUIs in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hosting Projects on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "What fun is a project if other people can't use it? By hosting your project on GitHub, you let others easily contribute to your project and build on it. Learning Git and GitHub are essential! And so are a few other skills along the way, like writing documents in Markdown. MiCM often has Git and GitHub workshops, so check out their workshop schedule!"
