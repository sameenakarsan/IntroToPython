# Intro to Python (Part 1)

**Workshop Lead: Benjamin Rudski**

**Facilitator: Sameena Karsan**

**Registration link: <https://forms.office.com/r/UwgvBnDrJ4>**

**Approximate duration: 4 hours**

**Prerequisites:**

-   Basic computer science knowledge of data types and control structures.
-   No prior programming experience is required, but knowing another language may help.
-   To be able to participate in the exercises, participants must either:
    -   Have a Google Account (to run in-browser as a Colab notebook; **preferred**).
    -   Have a local installation of Python and Jupyter notebooks. Microsoft Visual Studio Code with the Python extension installed can also be used to run the Notebook.

**Summary: (2-3 sentences summarizing the workshop)**

In this 4-hour workshop, participants will be introduced to the basics of programming in Python. Students will journey from the beginnings of creating variables and performing simple mathematical operations to writing code that can perform fundamental tasks and wrapping this code into functions. Participants will learn how to write the important building blocks that make up complex programs.

**Learning Objectives: (List 3-5 learning objectives participants will learn upon completion of this workshop)**

1. Store data in variables and collections.
2. Perform basic operations on these data.
3. Use control flow and loops to write powerful code.
4. Define functions to create repeatable units of behaviour.
